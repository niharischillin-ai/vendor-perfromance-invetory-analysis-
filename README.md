Vendor Performance & Inventory Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes vendor performance and inventory management to uncover inefficiencies, optimize pricing, and improve profitability in the retail/wholesale industry. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project identifies underperforming vendors, evaluates bulk purchasing advantages, and highlights inventory turnover challenges.

🎯 Business Problem

Effective inventory and vendor management are critical to profitability.
This analysis aims to:

Identify underperforming brands that need pricing/promotional adjustments.

Determine top vendors contributing most to sales and profits.

Evaluate the impact of bulk purchasing on cost savings.

Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs.

Compare profit margins between high and low-performing vendors.

🔍 Key Insights

Negative & Zero Values: Some products sold at a loss or were never sold.

Outliers: Huge variations in freight costs and product prices indicate inefficiencies.

Correlations: Strong link between purchase quantity and sales, but weak/negative links between turnover and profitability.

Top Vendors: 10 vendors contribute ~66% of purchases, posing supply chain risk.

Bulk Orders: Large orders cut unit costs by 72%.

Inventory Issues: $2.71M locked in unsold inventory.

Profit Margins: Low-performing vendors have higher margins but weak sales volumes.

📊 Research Findings

198 brands with high margins but low sales could benefit from promotions.

Vendor dependency is risky – diversify partnerships.

Bulk purchasing lowers costs and boosts competitiveness.

Slow-moving inventory drives high storage costs.

Profit margin differences between top and low vendors are statistically significant.

✅ Recommendations

Re-evaluate pricing for low-sales, high-margin brands.

Diversify supplier base to reduce risk.

Leverage bulk pricing for cost efficiency.

Reduce unsold inventory with clearance sales or smaller purchase orders.

Improve marketing and distribution for low-performing vendors.
